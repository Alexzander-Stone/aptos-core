// Out of the box the self_update crate assumes that you have releases named a
// specific way with the crate name, version, and target triple in a specific
// format. We don't do this with our releases, we have other GitHub releases beyond
// just the CLI, and we don't build for all major target triples, so we have to do
// some of the work ourselves first to figure out what the latest version of the
// CLI is and which binary to download based on the current OS. Then we can plug
// that into the library which takes care of the rest.
